# Translation

Ideascube translation is managed through [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/ideascube/dashboard/ideascube).


Once you added new strings to translate in the code source, you need to run the
following command:

    make collect_translations

Then you need to push them to Transifex, to make them available to
translators:

    make push_translations

Once new translations are available on Transifex, you need to run:

    make pull_translations

And then, to have the translations ready to use for Django:

    make compile_translations

Remember to commit the new translations and compiled files!

More about how Django manages translations in [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/i18n/).
