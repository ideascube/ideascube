# Translation

Ideascube translation is managed through [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/ideascube/dashboard/ideascube).

Head over there if you're interested in helping translate Ideascube in your
language.

The rest of this documentation is for Ideascube developers to manage the
translations.

---

Once you added new strings to translate in the source code, you need to run the
following command:

    make collect_translations

Then you need to push them to Transifex, to make them available to
translators:

    make push_translations

Once new translations are available on Transifex, you need to run:

    make pull_translations

And then, to have the translations ready to use for Django:

    make compile_translations

Remember to commit the new translations and compiled files!

More about how Django manages translations in [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/i18n/).
